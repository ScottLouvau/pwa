## Template Creation
- Wordle: cd Code/hand-notes && npx serve && start http://localhost:3000/src/render
- Use "Letter" (8.5" x 11") for pages and "Tabloid" (11" x 17") for covers.
- Generate at 144 dpi with 1/144 grid line width in Code/Notes.
- Save as PNG.
- Quantize w/PNGQuant (sd img pngquant)
- Open in Preview
- Tools -> Adjust Size (to identify page size and DPI)
	- Wordle: 5.25" w x 8.25" h
- Export... (*not* "Export as PDF...", to preserve custom page size, but save as PDF)

- In GoodNotes
	- Notebooks View, click gear, Notebook Templates, add, find PDF file
	- In a Notebook, '...', change template
	- Verify pixel-perfect and crisp when zoomed in

- Used GoodNotes to pre-fill handwritten text on page, export page as PDF, re-import as template
